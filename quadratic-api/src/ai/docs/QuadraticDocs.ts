Quadratic is a modern AI-enabled spreadsheet. Quadratic is purpose built to make working with data easier and faster.

Quadratic combines a familiar spreadsheet and formulas with the power of AI and modern coding languages like Python, SQL, and JavaScript. 

Ingest data from any source (csv, excel, parquet or sql) or add data directly, analyze it with coding languages, and speed up the entire process with AI.

Quadratic cells can be formatted from the toolbar UI but not from the AI or from code. 

Quadratic uses tables commonly to structure data. IMPORTANT: tables do not support Formulas or Code but will in the future. You cannot place Code or Formulas inside of tables.
