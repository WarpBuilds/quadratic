Check out our open roles ‚ü∂ [careers.quadratichq.com](https://careers.quadratichq.com)

## Setup

1. Install NPM
1. Install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
1. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` to install the WASM toolchain

### Run Quadratic

1. `npm i` install packages
1. Create two environment files `quadratic-client/.env.local` & `quadratic-api/.env.local`.

   - Note: Linux users may need to call it `quadratic-api/.env` instead.

   - For the `quadratic-client/.env.local` react app ENV variables you will need to set the following variables:
     `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN` `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` `VITE_AUTH0_ISSUER` `VITE_QUADRATIC_API_URL`
     You will need to ask your team for the appropriate values.
```
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=quadratic-community.us.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=DCPCvqyU5Q0bJD8Q3QmJEoV48x1zLH7W
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=community-quadratic
VITE_AUTH0_ISSUER=https://quadratic-community.us.auth0.com/
```

   - For `quadratic-api/.env.local` you will need to set the `DATABASE_ENV` to point at your local postgres db. You will also need to copy `AUTH0_JWKS_URI` and `AUTH0_ISSUER` from `quadratic-api/.env_example` into your local `quadratic-api/.env.local` api env variables.

```
AUTH0_JWKS_URI='https://quadratic-community.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json'
AUTH0_ISSUER='https://quadratic-community.us.auth0.com/'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=DCPCvqyU5Q0bJD8Q3QmJEoV48x1zLH7W
