7. Install [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

8. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

### Configure Auth0 account (Optional)

This is only required if the `quadratic-community` Auth0 account does not work.

1. Create an account on [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

2. Create a new Regular Web Application

3. In the settings tab, configure the following:
   - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/login-result?redirectTo`

### Configure .env files

1. Create .env files using the template .env.example files

   ```sh
    cp .env.example .env && \
    cp quadratic-api/.env.example quadratic-api/.env && \
    cp quadratic-client/.env.example quadratic-client/.env && \
    cp quadratic-files/.env.example quadratic-files/.env && \
    cp quadratic-multiplayer/.env.example quadratic-multiplayer/.env
   ```

   These are prefilled with `quadratic-community` Auth0 account credentials and values required to access services in docker.

2. If the `quadratic-community` Auth0 account does not work, update the Auth0 values in the following files with your Auth0 account values:

   - `.env`
   - `quadratic-api/.env`
   - `quadratic-client/.env`
   - `quadratic-multiplayer/.env`

## How to test js.rs functions (Rust functions that call into TS)

Use `#[serial]` from `use serial_test::serial;` for the test function (this
ensures that the global static `TEST_ARRAY` is not changed by other functions).

Any time a jsFunction is called from js.rs, the function and its args are added
to the `lazy_static TEST_ARRAY` in js.rs. You can access the results of that via
two functions:

`expect_js_call(name: &str, args: String, clear: bool)` - asserts whether the
function with the `name` has the args (usually formatted as `format!("{},{}",
&arg1, &arg2)` -- but check the js.rs for the actual format). This removes that
call from the `TEST_ARRAY`. If `clear` = true then it also clears the entire
`TEST_ARRAY` (which is needed since we don't have 100% coverage on all js.rs
calls yet).`

`expect_js_call_count(name: &str, count: usize, clear: bool)` - asserts whether
the `name` function was called a specific number of times. If it matches it will
clear the `TEST_ARRAY` of those functions. If `clear` = true then it will also
clear the entire `TEST_ARRAY` (for the same reason as above).
