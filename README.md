# What is Quadratic?

Quadratic is a Web-based spreadsheet application that runs in the browser and as a native app (via Electron).

Our goal is to build a spreadsheet that enables you to pull your data from its source (SaaS, database, CSV, API, etc) and then work with that data using the most popular data science tools today (Python, Pandas, SQL, JS, Formulas, etc).

## What can I do with Quadratic?

- Build dashboards
- Create internal tools in minutes
- Quickly mix data from different sources
- Explore your data for new insights
- Visualize your Python workflows as a spreadsheet
- Mix technical and non-technical team members in your analysis
