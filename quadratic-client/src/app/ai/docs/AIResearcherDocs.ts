# AI Researcher Docs

AI Researcher is a tool that allows users to search the web for information in context of their data referenced from the spreadsheet.

Aim is to directly get data from the web based on the user's query, and this data is directly returned to the user's spreadsheet and can be used for further calculations.

The output of the AI Researcher is a cell value directly inserted into the user's spreadsheet.

This is not a conversational AI agent, but a tool to directly get data from the web based on the user's query and context of their data in the spreadsheet.

The output needs to be a cell value, not a web page or a web page summary. It should be directly a value that can be used in the spreadsheet.
